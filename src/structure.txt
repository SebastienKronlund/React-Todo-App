Components:

        div - .app
            section - .form-section
                <Form />
            section - .list-section
                <TodoList />
                    <Todo />

            input - title
            input - description

    TodoList
        div - .todoContainer
            ul - .list

States:
    App:
        [formInputs, setFormInputs] = useState({title: "", description: ""});
        [todoList, setTodoList] = useState([]);


Objects:

    Todo
        {
            title: formInputs.title,
            description: formInputs.description
            completed: boolean
        }





Tech Requirements:
    - There MUST be a form input where the user can add a new todo.
    - On first load the list of todos MUST be empty.
    - When the user submits a new todo from the form the todo card MUST appear in the list.
    - Each todo card MUST be toggleable between 'done' and 'not done'.
    - There MUST be a remove-button on cards that are 'done' and when the user clicks the button it will be removed from the list completely.
    - Todo cards which are set to 'done' MUST appear on the bottom of the list, and they SHOULD be easy to visually separate.
    - The original order of the cards MUST be maintained if you toggle a card to 'done' and then back again.
    - It SHOULD be easy to add, toggle and remove todo's. For example adding a new card by hitting 'enter'

    - You MUST keep the todo-list in a state object, you can choose yourself where this should reside.
    - You MUST use at least 3 levels of components. In the simplest case this would be an App component in which you have a TodoList component containing TodoCard components.
    - You MUST use props for passing the necessary information to the todo components.
    -You MUST NOT use React Router, Hooks nor Redux.
